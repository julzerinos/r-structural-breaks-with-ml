# Detecting Structural Breaks with Statistical Analysis in R

## In a nutshell

Structural breaks in time series data indicate changes in long-term statistical trends. These may be detected with the help of simple machine learning/data analysis models such as regression. We use R to create the model and detect structural breaks in national economic GDP time series data.
