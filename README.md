## Abstract

Economists and the financial brotherhood of the world has always taken analysis of breakpoints intime series of data seriously. There is no wonder in the fact that there is great focus on automated(algorithm-aided) detection of these breakpoints where human error and bias can greatly influence theoutcome of analysis.

This paper aims to present a simple approach to breakpoint detection using the power of the statis-tical R programming language with fluctuation-based regression model parameter change analysis.

We demonstrate the approach on percentage change of RGDP (Real Gross Domestic Product) forboth developing and developed countries (from 1950 to 2020 where applicable) based on the availabledata in the open source World Penn Tables.
